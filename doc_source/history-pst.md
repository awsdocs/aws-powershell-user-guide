| [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1\.0\.1\.0](#history-pst) | The install location of the Tools for Windows PowerShell module has changed so that environments using Windows PowerShell version 3 can take advantage of auto\-loading\. The module and supporting files are now installed to an `AWSPowerShell` subfolder beneath `AWS ToolsPowerShell`\. Files from previous versions that exist in the `AWS ToolsPowerShell` folder are automatically removed by the installer\. The `PSModulePath` for Windows PowerShell \(all versions\) is updated in this release to contain the parent folder of the module \(`AWS ToolsPowerShell`\)\. For systems with Windows PowerShell version 2, the Start Menu shortcut is updated to import the module from the new location and then run `Initialize-AWSDefaults`\. For systems with Windows PowerShell version 3, the Start Menu shortcut is updated to remove the `Import-Module` command, leaving just `Initialize-AWSDefaults`\. If you edited your PowerShell profile to perform an `Import-Module` of the `AWSPowerShell.psd1` file, you will need to update it to point to the file's new location \(or, if using PowerShell version 3, remove the `Import-Module` statement as it is no longer needed\)\. As a result of these changes, the Tools for Windows PowerShell module is now listed as an available module when executing `Get-Module -ListAvailable`\. In addition, for users of Windows PowerShell version 3, the execution of any cmdlet exported by the module will automatically load the module in the current PowerShell shell without needing to use `Import-Module` first\. This enables interactive use of the cmdlets on a system with an execution policy that disallows script execution\. | December 21, 2012 | 
| [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1\.0\.0\.0](#history-pst) | Initial release | December 6, 2012 |
