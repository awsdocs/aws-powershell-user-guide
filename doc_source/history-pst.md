| [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 2\.3\.19](#history-pst) | Added information to the [Cmdlets Discovery and Aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-discovery-aliases.html) section about the new `Get-AWSCmdletName` cmdlet that can help users more easily find their desired AWS cmdlets\. | February 5, 2015 | 
| [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1\.1\.1\.0](#history-pst) | Collection output from cmdlets is always enumerated to the PowerShell pipeline\. Automatic support for pageable service calls\. New $AWSHistory shell variable collects service responses and optionally service requests\. AWSRegion instances use Region field instead of SystemName to aid pipelining\. Remove\-S3Bucket supports a \-DeleteObjects switch option\. Fixed usability issue with Set\-AWSCredentials\. Initialize\-AWSDefaults reports from where it obtained credentials and region data\.

| [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1\.0\.1\.0](#history-pst) | The install location of the Tools for Windows PowerShell module has changed so that environments using Windows PowerShell version 3 can take advantage of auto\-loading\. The module and supporting files are now installed to an *AWSPowerShell* subfolder beneath *AWS ToolsPowerShell*\. Files from previous versions that exist in the *AWS ToolsPowerShell* folder are automatically removed by the installer\. The `PSModulePath` for Windows PowerShell \(all versions\) is updated in this release to contain the parent folder of the module \(*AWS ToolsPowerShell*\)\. For systems with Windows PowerShell version 2, the Start Menu shortcut **Windows PowerShell for AWS** is updated to import the module from the new location and then run `Initialize-AWSDefaults`\. For systems with Windows PowerShell version 3, the Start Menu shortcut **Windows PowerShell for AWS** is updated to remove the `Import-Module` command, leaving just `Initialize-AWSDefaults`\. If you edited your PowerShell profile to perform an `Import-Module` of the `AWSPowerShell.psd1` file, you will need to update it to point to the file's new location \(or, if using PowerShell version 3, remove the `Import-Module` statement as it is no longer needed\)\. As a result of these changes, the Tools for Windows PowerShell module is now listed as an available module when executing `Get-Module -ListAvailable`\. In addition, for users of Windows PowerShell version 3, the execution of any cmdlet exported by the module will automatically load the module in the current PowerShell shell without needing to use `Import-Module` first\. This enables interactive use of the cmdlets on a system with an execution policy that disallows script execution\. | December 21, 2012 | 
| [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1\.0\.0\.0](#history-pst) | Initial release | December 6, 2012 |
