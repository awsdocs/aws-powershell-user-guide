This section provides examples of using the AWS Tools for PowerShell to access AWS services\. These examples help demonstrate how to use the cmdlets to perform actual AWS tasks\.

## PowerShell File Concatenation Encoding<a name="powershell-file-concatenation-encoding"></a>

Some cmdlets in the AWS Tools for PowerShell edit existing files or records that you have in AWS\. An example is `Edit-R53ResourceRecordSet`, which calls the [ChangeResourceRecordSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeResourceRecordSets.html) API for Amazon Route 53 \.

When you edit or concatenate files in PowerShell 5\.1 or older releases, PowerShell encodes the output in UTF\-16, not UTF\-8\. This can add unwanted characters and create results that are not valid\. A hexadecimal editor can reveal the unwanted characters\.

To avoid converting file output to UTF\-16, you can pipe your command into PowerShell's `Out-File` cmdlet and specify UTF\-8 encoding, as shown in the following example:

```
PS > *some file concatenation command* | Out-File filename.txt -Encoding utf8
```

If you are running AWS CLI commands from within the PowerShell console, the same behavior applies\. You can pipe the output of an AWS CLI command into `Out-File` in the PowerShell console\. Other cmdlets, such as `Export-Csv` or `Export-Clixml`, also have an `Encoding` parameter\. For a complete list of cmdlets that have an `Encoding` parameter, and that allow you to correct the encoding of the output of a concatenated file, run the following command:

```
PS > Get-Command -ParameterName "Encoding"
```

**Note**  
PowerShell 6\.0 and newer, including PowerShell Core, automatically retains UTF\-8 encoding for concatenated file output\.

## Returned Objects for the PowerShell Tools<a name="returned-objects-for-the-powershell-tools"></a>

To make AWS Tools for PowerShell more useful in a native PowerShell environment, the object returned by a AWS Tools for PowerShell cmdlet is a \.NET object, not the JSON text object that is typically returned from the corresponding API in the AWS SDK\. For example, `Get-S3Bucket` emits a `Buckets` collection, not an Amazon S3 JSON response object\. The `Buckets` collection can be placed in the PowerShell pipeline and interacted with in appropriate ways\. Similarly, `Get-EC2Instance` emits a `Reservation` \.NET object collection, not a `DescribeEC2Instances` JSON result object\. This behavior is by design and enables the AWS Tools for PowerShell experience to be more consistent with idiomatic PowerShell\.

The actual service responses are available for you if you need them\. They are stored as `note` properties on the returned objects\. For API actions that support paging by using `NextToken` fields, these are also attached as `note` properties\.
