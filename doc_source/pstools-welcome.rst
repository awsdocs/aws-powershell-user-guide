What are the AWS Tools for PowerShell?
######################################

The |TWPlong| and |TPClong| are PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by the
|sdk-net|. The AWS PowerShell Tools enable you to script operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell
command line. Although the cmdlets are implemented using the service clients and methods from the
SDK, the cmdlets provide an idiomatic PowerShell experience for specifying parameters and handling
results. For example, the cmdlets for the |TWP| support PowerShell pipelining |mdash| that is, you
can pipe PowerShell objects in and out of the cmdlets.

The |TWP| and |TPC| are flexible in how they enable you to handle credentials, including support for the
|IAMlong| (|IAM|) infrastructure; you can use the tools with |IAM| user credentials, temporary
security tokens, and |IAM| roles.

The |TWPALL| support the same set of services and regions that are supported by the SDK. You can install the |TWPALL| on computers running Windows-based, Linux-based, or macOS operating systems.
