# What Are the AWS Tools for PowerShell?<a name="pstools-welcome"></a>

The AWS Tools for PowerShell are a set of PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by the AWS SDK for \.NET\. The AWS Tools for PowerShell enable you to script operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell command line\. 

The cmdlets provide an idiomatic PowerShell experience for specifying parameters and handling results even though they are implemented using the various AWS service HTTP query APIs\. For example, the cmdlets for the AWS Tools for PowerShell support PowerShell pipeliningâ€”that is, you can pipe PowerShell objects in and out of the cmdlets\.

The AWS Tools for PowerShell are flexible in how they enable you to handle credentials, including support for the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) infrastructure\. You can use the tools with IAM user credentials, temporary security tokens, and IAM roles\.

The AWS Tools for PowerShell support the same set of services and AWS Regions that are supported by the SDK\. You can install the AWS Tools for PowerShell on computers running Windows, Linux, or macOS operating systems\.

**Note**  
AWS Tools for PowerShell version 4 is the latest major release, and is a backward\-compatible update to AWS Tools for PowerShell version 3\.3\. It adds significant improvements while maintaining existing cmdlet behavior\. Your existing scripts should continue to work after upgrading to the new version, but we do recommend that you test them thoroughly before upgrading\. For more information about the changes in version 4, see [Migrating from AWS Tools for PowerShell Version 3\.3 to Version 4](v4migration.md)\.

The AWS Tools for PowerShell are available as the following three distinct packages:
+ [AWS\.Tools](#pwsh_structure_pstools)
+ [AWSPowerShell\.NetCore](#pwsh_structure_pscore)
+ [AWSPowerShell](#pwsh_structure_psoldwin)

This version of AWS Tools for PowerShell is the recommended version for any computer running PowerShell in a production environment\. Because it's modularized, you need to download and load only the modules for the services you want to use\. This reduces download times, memory usage, and enables auto\-importing of AWS\.Tools cmdlets without the need to manually call `Import-Module` first\.

This is the latest version of AWS Tools for PowerShell and runs on all supported operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS\. This package provides one installation module, `AWS.Tools.Installer`, one common module, `AWS.Tools.Common`, and one module for each AWS service, for example, `AWS.Tools.EC2`, `AWS.Tools.IAM`, `AWS.Tools.S3`, and so on\.

The `AWS.Tools.Installer` module provides cmdlets that enable you to install, update, and remove the modules for each of the AWS services\. The cmdlets in this module automatically ensure that you have all the dependent modules required to support the modules you want to use\.

The `AWS.Tools.Common` module provides cmdlets for configuration and authentication that are not service specific\. To use the cmdlets for an AWS service, you just run the command\. PowerShell automatically imports the `AWS.Tools.Common` module and the module for the AWS service whose cmdlet you want to run\. This module is automatically installed if you use the `AWS.Tools.Installer` module to install the service modules\.

You can install this version of AWS Tools for PowerShell on computers that are running:
+ PowerShell Core 6\.0 or later on Windows, Linux, or macOS\.
+ Windows PowerShell 5\.1 or later on Windows with the \.NET Framework 4\.7\.2 or later\.
